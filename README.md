# Classification_using_cifar10_database
This is a convolutional neural network model
It has 3 convolutional layers
4 layers of neural networks with 1000, 500, 250, and 10 neurons respectively
Model is fitted using a batch size of 256 and 20 epoches
Thereafter the model is visualised on the accuracy and loss of training data and validation data
There after the model is tested using a random picture and the top 5 classes are predicted
